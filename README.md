# kilo-zig
Kilo text editor written in Zig

Followed the turorial at https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/

Mostly completed, only did the beginning of the syntax highlighting

At some point I may try integrate tree-sitter for the highlighting, although I think I would need to change how the file data is handled. Maybe I try a rope
